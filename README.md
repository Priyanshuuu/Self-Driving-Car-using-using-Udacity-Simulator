# Self-Driving-Car-using-using-Udacity-Simulator
## Divided in to three parts.
1. Dataset Gathering.
2. Keras Model Implimentation.
3. Training Model.
4. Testing and Execution

## Details
- In this Project, I have used Udacity simulator to Gather the datasets with 3 cameras.
- Then, I have trained my keras model by passsing the **images**,**throttle** and **steering angle** information to my dense Keras model.
- Then, I have used my saved **.h5** extension based keras model to execute.
- For Executio, I have used udacity **Autonomous Mode**.
